            <p>Understanding and applying this concept is important for you to be able to effectively engage and guide
                users to take and compplete the desired action.</p>
            <p>Visual hierarchy is a way of organizing design elements based on their importance. It helps create a user
                experience that directs attention to specific focal points, such as text, images, or buttons.
                Details like colorful logos, white space, bold typography, and more influence what catches a visitor's
                eye. However, the arrangement of these design elements is crucial. Consider where you would naturally
                look for information on a website. Typically, people start at the top or center before exploring less
                noticeable elements. In web design, visual hierarchy anticipates this user behavior by placing important
                information, like calls to action (CTAs), in the spots that are most likely to be seen first.
            </p>
            <h3>7 principles of visual hierarchy for web designers</h3>
            <p>Awareness of these concepts can help you make more intentional design decisions.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Reading Patterns</dt>
                <dd>In this concept, we reference the z-pattern layout and f-pattern layout. Both of these patterns are
                    based on the reading habits of Western cultures, which read from left to right. This allows
                    strategically placing information to tell a cohesive story that makes sense to visitors.</dd>

                <dt>Rule of Thirds</dt>
                <dd>
                    This indicates that you should see elements as inside a grid or rectangle. The rectangle is divided
                    into thirds, both vertically and horizontally. The division creates four points of intersection,
                    which are used to place elements of interest. With the intersection points as reference, elements
                    can be placed in one, some, or all of them.
                </dd>
                <dt>Size and Scale</dt>
                <dd>
                    These properties are used to to communicate prioritaized information. On one hand, size referes to
                    dimensions of an element, and on the other hand, scale is defined as measure of proportion relative
                    to other elements on the document. Larger elements will tend to attract more attention in the
                    hierarchy, while smaller ones are secondary.
                </dd>
                <dt>Typography</dt>
                <dd>
                    Typography's visual hierarchy involves purposeful pairing of fonts and using varying font sizes to
                    emphasize text-based information. Your key concepts should be presented in more prominent or bold
                    text, capturing the attention of visitors and encouraging interaction. Meanwhile, supporting text
                    can be presented in a smaller or less dominant font. A typical hierarchy may commence with a bold
                    headline, followed by medium-sized subheadings, and concluding with smaller body text.
                </dd>
                <dt>Color and contrast</dt>
                <dd>Employing strategic color and contrast guides visitors' attention to the elements you wish to
                    prioritize. A CTA button with high contrast will visually stand out against a subdued background
                    (and vice versa), and vibrant illustrations contribute visual interest while effectively conveying
                    ideas. </dd>
                <dt>White space</dt>
                <dd>Negative space, commonly referred to as white space, plays a crucial role in enhancing legibility
                    and maintaining a balanced visual hierarchy. It serves to prevent an overcrowded layout by ensuring
                    that elements are not excessively cluttered. The deliberate inclusion of white or negative space
                    around and between elements facilitates a more focused and distraction-free absorption of
                    information by the readers.</dd>
                <dt>Proximity and repetition</dt>
                <dd>The human brain instinctively looks for patterns. By strategically positioning web elements in close
                    proximity or employing patterns to structure them, visitors can easily grasp their relationships and
                    purposes. For instance, if your website features a blog, arranging posts either side by side or
                    stacked on top of each other conveys to visitors that they share a common purpose. This intentional
                    organization aids in enhancing user understanding and navigation.</dd>

            <h2>Fitts's Law </h2>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/co/">https://www.apple.com/co/</a>

            <p>
                Fitts's Law, in the realm of UX and web design, emphasizes the principle that the time required to move
                to a target is a function of the target's size and distance. In practical terms, this means that larger
                and closer elements on a website are more accessible and easier for users to interact with. By
                strategically designing user interfaces with this law in mind, we prioritize the placement and size of
                interactive elements, such as buttons or links, to optimize user experience. Essentially, Fitts's Law
                guides us in creating interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitively navigable,
                enhancing overall usability and engagement.

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
            <p>Youtube</p>
            <a href="https://m.youtube.com/">https://m.youtube.com/</a>
            <img src="./images/PARC: Repetition Good example.jpg" alt="Principle description">
            <p>In the context of design principles, PARC stands for Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, and Contrast. Each element contributes to creating visually appealing and effective designs. Let's focus on Repetition:

                Repetition in design involves the consistent use of certain elements throughout a layout to establish a sense of unity and cohesiveness. It helps reinforce the overall visual identity and branding. In web design, repetition can be seen in consistent navigation menus, button styles, or the recurring use of certain colors and fonts. By incorporating repetition strategically, a designer can guide users through a seamless and familiar experience, making the interface more intuitive and reinforcing key design elements. This principle not only enhances aesthetics but also contributes to a more user-friendly and memorable website or application.</p>
